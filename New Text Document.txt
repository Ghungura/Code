1. Download node js for windows

Below are the mandatory commands for getting started

npm install -g protractor

webdriver-manager update

webdriver-manager start

2. Please download the software with name :  Eclipse IDE for JavaScript and Web Developers from below link

https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/oxygen/3a

3. Webstrom provided by intellige to develop code.It is a javascript IDE.
 but It is a paid tool. So we can go for above eclipse ide for java script and web developers

4. protractor uses jasmine framework to develop TCs  to code TC
5. Termionology:

describe -Test Suite
it - TestCase

spec - Testfile (same as java class file)

Every spec should have describe and it block

configuration file - spec file name (same as TestNG xml file, which spec we want to execute can be triggered from here)
right click on project=>create javascript file->Name as configuration.js

6. Sample code:

   /**
 * 
 */

describe('Protractor baby steps',function() {  


it('Open Angular js website',function() {





//write your protractor raw code



})

 


//Each it block will be called as a spec



it('close browswer', function() {



// code to close browser
})



})

Sample Configuration file:
exports.config = {
seleniumAddress : 'http://localhost:4444/wd/hub',

    specs: ['spec1.js'],
 
}
 
4444--Port where the webdriver manager has started

7. cli.js file path:

   C:\Users\91890\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\protractor\built\cli.js

to run the TCs we have to configure protractor Test Runner
 
write click on project-> run as configuration->in the left pannel search node js application

in the configuration window select the project

in the workplace we have to select cli.js file, that we can't select from external source like from local file system
for that copy the  C:\Users\91890\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\protractor folder in your project level in the eclipse. so that cli.js can be selected from projevt folder.


each it block is treated as one spec in Jasmine framework

8. Download Angular Js Plugin from Eclipse Market Place
9. Right click on project->config->convert to tern project
   with this we will get auto suggestion  whilecoding

10. Java script is asynchronus

    suppose there are two stattement to invoke some URL and after that logging something in console.While executing 
    logging statement is executing even before invoking the URL. In this case order of execution is not mentained.
    This is one of asynchronus issue.

11. Every Javascript steps returns promise
    promise is the state of the step or the result of the step
    Promise has 3 steps: Pending,Resplved,Rejected

   In synchronus: you will move to next step only after promise for current step is either resplved/rejected

   In asynchronus:move to next step even if promise is pending
   90% of protractor API will not move to next step until the promise is resolved

12. If performing action on browser Protractor API will take care of Promise (click(),sendkeys() etc..)

    If want to retrive anything from browser then that particular functionality related methods have not support of prmise resolving
    for eg. gettitle(),gettext(), console.log

13. Protractor Global varibales:
     protractor exports global varibales to your spec(test) file
    
     a) Browser: eg: browser.get()
     b)element: helper function to find and interact with elements in DOM.It takes locator as an argument
     c)By
     d)protractor, protractor.key

14.commonly used locators:
   by.css, by.id,by,name,by.model,by.binding
   All the locators supported by selenium are supported by protractor as well. It supports some other locators as well like model, binding etc.
15.If in the DOM ng is mentioned it is an angular code

16.Running in different browser
   
  chromedriver and gecko driver is installed automatically when we do "webdriver-manager update"  in the below path
 
C:\Users\91890\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\protractor\node_modules\webdriver-manager\selenium

to download iedriver type "webdriver-manager update --ie"

17.. Executing protractor on Non angular site
    
    add this step before invoking non angular site
   browser.waitForAngularEnabled(fasle)
